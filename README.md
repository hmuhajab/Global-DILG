# Populating Saudi Arabia Data

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and related files for processing geographic data related to Saudi Arabia. The goal is to create and populate a knowledge graph that integrates geographic information using RDF, focusing on populated places within Saudi Arabia.

## Repository Contents

- **`populating_SaudiArabia_Data.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook that processes JSON files containing geographic data, generates RDF triples, and updates relationships within the RDF graph.
- **`Global_DLIGS.rdf`**: An RDF ontology file used as a base for loading and populating new geographic data.
- **`Data.zip`**: Contains the raw JSON files and other supporting data required for processing.
- **`Saudi_KG.zip`**: Contains the populated knowledge graph.

## Overview of the Jupyter Notebook
This contains the Global _DLIGS data model and the code for populating the data into the model. The Saudi_KG zip folder contains the geographic linked data.
